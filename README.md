# CodeAlpha_Data-Science-Task1-Iris-Flower-Classification
This project involves a complete data analysis of an ISIS-related dataset using Python. The objective of the project is to clean, explore, and analyze the dataset to identify patterns and insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

# Iris Flower Classification with Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether a flower belongs to Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Highlights
- Used Iris flower measurements as input data
- Trained a machine learning classification model
- Evaluated model accuracy and performance
- Learned basic classification concepts in machine learning

## Dataset
The Iris dataset containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three Iris flower species.

## Steps Done
- Data exploration & visualization
- Preprocessing
- Model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model comparison & conclusion

## Results
- Best Model: Random Forest
- Tuned Accuracy: 99%

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
